### Approach: 

 Chatgpt acted as a real estate investigator.  I communicated with Chatgpt and include questions like belows to make sure the initiative: 
	+  What your daily work is? And how you wish this dashboard can help you?
	+  How do you expect this dashboard to help you take action?


### Initiatives:
ðŸ“Œ The Key Use Cases Are:
1. Spot Market Shifts & Adjust Investigation Focus 
	+ Goal: Identify districts with unusual price trends (sharp increase or drop).
	+ Action: Investigate further if something looks offâ€”e.g., zoning changes, foreclosures, distressed sales.

2. Identify Suspicious Transactions Faster (TBD)
	   + Goal: Flag transactions that are far above or below market price.
	   + Action: Pull transaction details, ownership history, and legal records for review.
	
3. Compare Investment Opportunities More Efficiently (TBD)
	+ Goal: See where prices are rising, rental yields are attractive, or transaction volume is healthy.
	+ Action: Recommend promising districts to investors based on dataâ€”not gut feeling.
