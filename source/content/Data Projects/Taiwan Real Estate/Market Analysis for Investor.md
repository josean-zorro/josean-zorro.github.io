### Approach: 

 AI played the role of real estate investigator. What I focused on in the communication to generate the persona and user story:

+ What does their daily work look like?
+ How does this dashboard help him/her in his/her daily work?
+ What success would you like to achieve with this dashboard?

Note: After a few communications, we also confirmed that the total price is less fundamental for investors because they have little budget concerns. Therefore, we mostly show unit prices and transaction amounts in the dashboard.

### Initiatives:
ðŸ“Œ The Key Use Cases Are:
1. Spot Market Shifts & Adjust Investigation Focus 
	+ User Story: As a real estate investor, I'd like to know which area has fluctuated the most recently to decide where to focus on a deeper investigation.
	+ TBD: The following data could help the investor dig deeper into the region of interest.
		+ Zone Information
		+ Owner History
		+ Crime Rate / Legal Risk Data
		+ Urban Plan / Zone Change information

2. Identify Suspicious Transactions Faster (TBD)
	+ User Story: As a real estate investor, I'd like to know if there is any specific transaction where the unit price is significantly above or below the district average so that I can detect potential fraudulent, distressed, or under-the-table deals and review the transaction history of the property.
	
3. Compare Investment Opportunities More Efficiently (TBD)
	+ User Story: As a real estate investigator advising investors, I want to compare districts based on price growth, transaction volume, and rental yield (when available) so that I can provide confident, data-driven investment recommendations to our clients.
